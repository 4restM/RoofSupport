## RoofSupport for Alpha 17

This is an open source mod for the game RimWorld. With the vanilla game, you have to use large walls to support roof tiles. Now you can build roof supports that no longer block the tile nor provide cover.
Use this mod to create vast storage bunkers, or patios around your structures.

When using underneath a mountain, don't forget to construct a roof. This is an ongoing issue with using structures of any sort with a mountainous roof.
